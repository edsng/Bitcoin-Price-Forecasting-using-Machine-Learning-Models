# Bitcoin-Price-Forecasting-using-Machine-Learning-Models
Bitcoin Price Forecasting using k-Nearest Neighbors and Long Short Term Memory

## Purpose
My father and I have been interested in the crypto markets since the start of the crypto boom. I was interested in seeing if we could run a model on the historic Bitcoin price data in order to predict future price trends. The models I will be testing are the k-Nearest Neighbors and Long Short Term Memory Models.
